## **Usage**

### **Blocking Websites**

2. If you visit a blocked site, a **custom block page** will appear with an option to **Allow the Site**.

### **Managing the Blocklist**

- Open the extension **Settings**:
   - Click the **AI Blocker** icon in the toolbar.
   - Select **"Manage Blocklist"** (opens a full-screen page).
- **Add Websites**:
   - Enter the domain (e.g., `example.com`) in the input field under the **Blocklist** section.
   - Click **Add**.
- **Remove Websites**:
   - Click the **Remove** button next to a website. The domain will automatically move to the allowlist.

### **Allowlist Management**

- The allowlist shows domains removed from the blocklist.
- To **move a website back to the blocklist**, click the **"Add to Blocklist"** button next to the domain in the allowlist.

### **Google Search Filtering**

- All Google search queries automatically append `-ai` to exclude AI-related results.

## **Default Blocklist**

The following domains are blocked by default:

| Domain              | Description                  |
|---------------------|------------------------------|
| `openai.com`        | OpenAI services (ChatGPT)    |
| `bard.google.com`   | Google's Bard AI             |
| `gemini.google.com` | Google's Gemini AI           |
| `chatgpt.com`       | ChatGPT web services         |

## **How It Works**

1. **Blocking Mechanism**:
   - The extension checks the current domain against a merged list of the **default blocklist** and user-defined blocklist.
   - If matched, the page is replaced with a **custom block page**.

2. **Dynamic Updates**:
   - Adding or removing domains dynamically updates the blocklist or allowlist using `chrome.storage.sync`.

3. **Custom Block Page**:
   - Users can **"Allow This Site"**, which moves it to the allowlist.
